For example:\n\n*'We started with 100 bacteria and now have 6,400. How many generations passed?'*\n\nThe population formula is: N = N₀ × 2^t (for doubling each generation).\nWe know N = 6,400 and N₀ = 100, so:\n6,400 = 100 × 2^t → 64 = 2^t\n\nTo solve for t (the unknown exponent), we need to 'undo' the exponential. That's what logarithms do:\nt = log₂(64) = **6 generations**\n\nLogarithms let us solve for the exponent—the 'hidden' time variable in growth equations."
