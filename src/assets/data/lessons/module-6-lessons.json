Mathematically:\n- Going from 1 lb to 2 lb (2× ratio) feels like a certain increase\n- Going from 10 lb to 20 lb (same 2× ratio) feels like the *same* increase\n\nSince perception responds to **ratios**, and logarithms turn ratios into differences (log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b)), logarithmic scales naturally describe our senses."
