          "content": "**Where does the '90% area → 50% species' rule come from?**\n\nLet's work through the math. The species-area relationship is S = cA^z, where z ≈ 0.25 typically.\n\nIf we reduce area by 90% (A → 0.1A):\n- New species: S_new = c(0.1A)^0.25 = c × 0.1^0.25 × A^0.25\n- Ratio: S_new/S_old = 0.1^0.25 = **0.56**\n\nSo about 56% of species remain—roughly **half**.\n\nThis has sobering implications: destroying 90% of a habitat doesn't just displace species—it likely drives half of them to extinction. Conservation reserves need to be large to preserve biodiversity."
