          "content": "But how do we discover if data follows a power law? Here's the key insight:\n\nIf Y = aX^b, taking logarithms of both sides gives:\n**log(Y) = log(a) + b × log(X)**\n\nThis is now in the form y = mx + c—a straight line!\n\nWhen we plot log(Y) vs log(X):\n- The **slope** equals the exponent b\n- The **y-intercept** equals log(a)\n\nSo by plotting data on log-log axes, we can:\n1. Visually check if it follows a power law (does it look straight?)\n2. Read off the exponent directly from the slope\n\nThis is why logarithms are essential for discovering and analyzing these relationships."

This is why elephants can exist—if they had mouse-level metabolism per gram, they'd cook themselves!"
