    - Forest B: H' = 2.1, 60 species
    
    Which forest is "more diverse"? Discuss the tension between these metrics.

13. MacArthur and Wilson predicted that near islands receive more colonizers and small islands have higher extinction rates. Sketch the equilibrium model showing how these two curves determine species number.

14. A conservation planner must choose between protecting one 100 km² reserve or four 25 km² reserves. Using species-area relationships, analyze the "single large or several small" (SLOSS) debate.

15. Climate change is shifting species' ranges. If a mountain habitat "island" shrinks from 500 km² to 300 km² as suitable habitat moves upward, estimate species loss (z = 0.25).

**Challenge Problems**

16. The log-series distribution predicts that species abundance follows: α × x^n/n, where x is a fitted parameter. Explain why this means rare species are most common.

17. Neutral theory (Hubbell) suggests species are equivalent and diversity patterns emerge from random processes. How does this contrast with niche theory? What evidence supports each?

18. Design a sampling protocol to estimate species diversity in a forest. Address: How many plots? What size? How do you account for rare species?

19. The "extinction debt" concept suggests that habitat loss has delayed effects on species numbers. Explain this phenomenon and its implications for conservation.

20. Research the application of Shannon entropy beyond ecology (e.g., information theory, linguistics). How is the same mathematical formula used in different fields?

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Identity

An organic, nature-inspired aesthetic using earthy greens, deep blues, and warm amber accents. The design evokes scientific journals and field notebooks while remaining modern and accessible. Typography emphasizes clarity and hierarchy, with careful attention to readability across devices.

### Accessibility

The platform prioritizes inclusive design with high contrast options, screen reader compatibility, full keyboard navigation support, and alternative text for all visualizations. Color choices account for various forms of color blindness.

### Mobile Responsiveness

Full functionality on tablets and smartphones enables learning on the go, with touch-optimized interactions that maintain the richness of the desktop experience. Visualizations adapt gracefully to smaller screens.

### Cognitive Load Management

Information is revealed progressively to avoid overwhelming learners. Complex visualizations build step-by-step with clear narration, allowing users to process each concept before advancing to the next layer of complexity.

## Assessment Strategy

### Formative Assessment

Quick comprehension checks appear after each concept introduction. Interactive "what-if" scenarios test intuition and encourage experimentation. Drag-and-drop matching exercises reinforce connections between mathematical forms and biological interpretations.

### Summative Assessment

Module quizzes feature varied question types including multiple choice, numerical entry, and graphical interpretation. A capstone project challenges learners to analyze a real biological dataset using logarithmic tools. Self-reflection prompts encourage metacognition about learning progress.

## Summary

This project transforms logarithms from an abstract mathematical topic into a practical toolkit for understanding biology. By anchoring every concept in tangible biological phenomena—from the pH of blood to the metabolism of elephants—learners develop intuition that persists far beyond the classroom.

The interactive visualizations make invisible relationships visible, while the biological framing answers the perennial student question: *"When will I ever use this?"*
